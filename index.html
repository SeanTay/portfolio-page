  <h1> About me </h1>
  <p>I am a Full Stack Developer from North Carolina Living in Washington DC.  In my previous life I was a mechanical engineer but after years of teaching myself how to code, my passion for technology and creativity led me to pursue my dream as a developer.  I like to think of myself as a technical creative because I love design as much as developing code.</p>

  <p>I love talking about anything tech, so hit me up
